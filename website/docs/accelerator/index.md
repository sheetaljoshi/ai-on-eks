# Accelerator for AI/ML on EKS

The Accelerator is a 6-week hands-on program that helps customers evaluate running open-source models on Amazon EKS. The program targets customers who have a defined business use case and in-house Kubernetes expertise and want to assess whether fine-tuning an OSS model on EKS will improve response quality, reduce costs, and lower latency compared to their current approach. Each week combines structured sessions with independent work time. Customers attend 2-3 hours of instruction and complete 2-3 days of hands-on implementation. The program follows a clear progression from infrastructure setup through production readiness. By the end of Week 6, customers will have a working solution with documented cost attribution, performance metrics, and a clear path to production.
